# Continuous Monitoring on Docker with ELK Stack

## Project 2

### Project Objective

Continuous Monitoring (CM) on Docker with ELK stack is a process designed to help developers monitor applications in real-time using Kibana.

### Background

XYZ Technology Solutions has hired you as a DevOps Engineer to implement infrastructure changes in the organization. The company is transitioning to DevOps practices for developing and delivering products. Following the agile Scrum methodology, XYZ decides to dockerize their applications for deployment on Kubernetes. Each deployed application will have a unique URL and port for access.

During the requirement analysis phase, the following conditions were agreed upon:

### Application Features

- The application and its versions should be available on GitHub.
- Code should be committed multiple times with versions tracked on GitHub.
- Build the application in Docker and host it on Docker Hub.
- Deploy the ELK stack on Docker and push application logs to it.
- Automate Docker build and deployment using Jenkins pipeline code.

### Tools Used

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Elasticsearch
- Logstash
- Kibana
- Spring Boot application

This project aims to establish a streamlined process for continuous monitoring on Docker using the ELK stack. It includes version control on GitHub, Dockerization of applications, deployment with Kubernetes, and automation through Jenkins pipelines.
